# GymPlanner

## What is the GymPlanner?
The GymPlanner app prides itself in organizing your workout needs. No set schedule, no clutter, no nothing. The app is made for *you* to be able
to set yourself whatever exercises you need! Exercise means something different to each person, so putting making an app that puts you in a box restricting
what you can do isn't what we have in mind!

### Exercise Inputting
Gone are the days of carrying that notepad around with you everywhere you go! Simply input your exercises for the day and that's it!

### To-Do Notes
Self-improvement doesn't happen overnight. Setting goals for yourself is very helpful to keep improving! If that isn't your style,
you can use the notes to keep track of whatever you need! Do you want to write out your workout split? You can do that! Do you want to slot in important reminders? 
That works too! Whatever you feel works best for you is the right way to use the notes!
